# PROG7311POE


I developed a prototype web application using vs

Setup: We downloaded Visual Studio for designing and implementing features, and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for managing the database.
User Authentication: We built registration and login pages.
ASP.NET Core Web App: We created an ASP.NET Core MVC web application in Visual Studio.
Models and Database: We defined models for users, farmers, and products, and set up a DbContext class. Using migrations, we created tables in the database.
Controllers and Views: We added code for the website's design and functionality.
Roles and Access Control: We implemented roles to control user access.
When users run the app, they need to register or log in. Registration requires their name, email, password, and role (farmer or employee).

Employees: Can add farmers, view and filter products, and manage roles.
Farmers: Can add, view, update, and delete their own products.
Unauthorized access attempts result in an "access denied" message. This app is designed to be easy to use and effective for stock management. Employees have broad access, while farmers have access tailored to their needs. Developing this app was enjoyable, and I hope it benefits and educates others as well.
